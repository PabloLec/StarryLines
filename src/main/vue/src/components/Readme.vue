          StarryLines retrieves from GitHub the best repositories for each
          language and then ranks them by the ratio between the number of stars
          and the number of lines of code.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is to find the lines of code that seem to have been
          proportionally the most interesting for the greatest number of
          developers. Useful for learning or just for curiosity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-xl mt-2">- What should not be in StarryLines</div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Tutorials, cheatsheets, boilerplates, roadmaps and other directories
          that are not code or not actual projects. Some filters are in place as
          well as a manual exclusion list.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible that there are irrelevant entries in the tables. If you
          think you see a repository that doesn't belong, please open an issue.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-2xl mt-6 font-bold text-mikado">Score calculation</div>
      <div>
        The score is obtained by dividing the number of stars by the number of
        lines of code. Star count is adjusted and several operations are applied
        on the code to obtain a relevant number of lines.
      </div>
      <div class="text-xl mt-2">- Star count</div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Although the star count displayed in the table is left unchanged, the
          one taken into account is adjusted. The number of stars is divided by
          the proportion of code written in the main language.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a repository whose main language is C, composed of 60% C and 40%
          Python with 100 stars in total, the final star count will be 60.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-xl mt-2">- Lines of code</div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The entire code is analyzed and stripped of comments or documentation.
          The number of lines is calculated by the number of characters divided
          by 80 for each file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to obtain a fair result, without penalizing the
          repositories with the most documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, only files written in the main language are retained, the
          others are ignored.
